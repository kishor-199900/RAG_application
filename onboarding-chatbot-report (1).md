# AI Chatbot for User Onboarding: Development Report

## Approach

Our approach to building the AI-powered onboarding chatbot involved three main phases:

1. **Basic Chatbot Implementation**: We used LangChain to create a conversational agent that could ask predefined onboarding questions and store user responses in a database.

2. **Knowledge Base Integration**: We implemented a knowledge base using Llama Index to provide additional information when users requested help.

3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: We enhanced the chatbot with RAG techniques using FAISS as a vector store, allowing for more contextual and accurate responses to user queries.

## Key Components

1. **LangChain**: Used for creating the conversational flow and interfacing with the language model.
2. **FAISS**: Implemented as an efficient vector store for similarity search.
3. **SQLAlchemy**: Used for database operations to store user responses.
4. **OpenAI's GPT**: Serves as the underlying language model for generating responses.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Integrating multiple components (LangChain, FAISS, SQLAlchemy) seamlessly.
   **Solution**: We carefully structured the code to separate concerns and used factory functions to initialize complex components.

2. **Challenge**: Balancing between following a structured onboarding flow and allowing flexibility for user questions.
   **Solution**: We implemented a hybrid approach where the chatbot follows a predefined question flow but allows users to ask for help or additional information at any time.

3. **Challenge**: Ensuring the chatbot provides accurate and contextual information from the knowledge base.
   **Solution**: We implemented RAG techniques, which combine retrieval of relevant information with language model generation, resulting in more informed and contextual responses.

4. **Challenge**: Handling various types of user input (e.g., direct answers, help requests, off-topic questions).
   **Solution**: We implemented conditional logic in the conversation flow to handle different types of user input and route them appropriately.

5. **Challenge**: Making the system easily extensible for future improvements.
   **Solution**: We designed the code with modularity in mind, separating database operations, knowledge base handling, and conversation logic into distinct functions and classes.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement more sophisticated error handling and input validation.
2. Enhance the RAG system with techniques like re-ranking or multi-step reasoning.
3. Add support for multi-turn conversations within the help system.
4. Implement a web interface for easier interaction with the chatbot.
5. Expand the knowledge base to cover a wider range of topics and integrate with external data sources.

## Conclusion

The developed AI chatbot successfully combines structured onboarding with flexible question-answering capabilities. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques like RAG, we've created a system that can guide users through a predefined process while also providing detailed, context-aware responses to their queries. This approach significantly enhances the user onboarding experience, making it more interactive, informative, and adaptable to individual user needs.
